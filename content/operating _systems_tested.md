>**Note:** To use PCB under the Windows 7 OS, you must be sure to install PCB using the "Run as Administrator" option. To find this option, right-click on the Setup.exe installer program icon. In the context menu, you will see the "Run as Administrator" option. Left-click to use this install option. Be aware, you must install using this option even if you are already logged in as an Administrator on your network or personal computer (PC). Using the "Run as Administrator" option will allow the PCB installer to create folders and files on your PC with proper permissions and security. If you do not use the "Run as Administrator" option, PCB may appear to install correctly; but you will receive numerous, repeating file access errors whenever PCB is running, especially when changing configuration screens. If this happens, to eliminate the errors, you will have to completely uninstall PCB and then re-install using the "Run as Administrator" option.
