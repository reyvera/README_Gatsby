1. Possible issues with earlier versions of Windows XP and the installation of ProSoft fdt Configuration Manager. If installing ProSoft Configuration Builder in an XP OS, make sure the OS is updated with the latest Service Packs and .NET Framework.
2. When attempting to delete a second project in PCB, a Save As dialog box will appear inferring the configuration file will be saved. When this configuration file is saved, the old project file is lost.
3. When uploading from two different modules in the same project without first closing and reopening PCB, the second module is renamed with the first module's name.
4. Exporting the configuration of any module generates an error that an intermediate file is missing and the export is not completed. This does not affect CID files, AOI files, or PROFIBUS files.
5. The PLX32-EIP-MBTCP-UA Security Jumper (J3) will NOT prohibit the user from accomplishing a Cold Boot option from the diagnostic screen of PCB.
